# OpenWeatherMap

This repo contains two self contained projects for getting data from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/forecast5).

`react-app` contains a React application.
`node-app` contains a node express server application.

These could obviously be married together, but for the purposes of this exercise were kept separate to keep to spec.

Further details are available in the README.md of each project.
